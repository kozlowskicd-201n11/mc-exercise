# Hai's Notes
Important to pull from whatever branch you're working on IF there are existing changes by your team members to avoid merge conflicks.
Also when merging a updated branch into master if there's a merge conflicts then choose all the things you want to keep and delete the "conflict's notation"
There will be times when we have a certain idea ebtalished in master and ending up not using that and want to use the updated branch instead. This is where you need to pick what version you want to keep and delete the others.
